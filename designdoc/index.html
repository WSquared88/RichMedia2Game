	<h1>Rich Media 2 Project</h1>
	
	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>
		My game is a digital adaptation of an analog game currently being developed in a team in Production Studio.
		Currently, our team has 2 people working on this digital adaptation: Westley Waligora and Peter McNamara.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our game is a strategic card game where you and an opponent play cards on a board and have them attack each other.
		The first player to destroy the opponents leader wins.
	</p>
	
	<h2>High Level Concept</h2>
	<p>
		In our game, units on the board attack other units, and claim "mana springs" to gain players resources.
		Players have a deck, a graveyard, their cards on the battlefield, and a special leader unit on the battlefield
	</p>
	
	<h2>User Experience</h2>
	<p>
		This game is a two player game. The mechanics of the game is that the player will be able to draw from a deck, play cards on the board, activate card abilities, move cards, 
		and attack with cards. Players can play their cards and spawn units in their home zone and move them around the board and onto mana springs which give the players mana to 
		play more cards with. Each player will also have a leader that if that unit dies then that player loses the game. There are also multiple different mechanics that the cards 
		can have like doing something while it is on a mana spring, doing something when a nearby unit dies, or allowing units to spawn nearby another unit instead of in the spawn zone.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		We aim to make user experience great and give each player quick access to cards in hand and on the board. There will also be a text box that shows 
		the descriptions of each card so that people don't have to read the text on the cards and can instead just read them from the text box. Whenever a player wants to move or 
		attack the game will automatically highlight the applicable targets so that players don't have to remember the rules as much.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Multi-user System</h2>
	<p>
		This game is a multi-user system because there will be two players that play together on a server. The server will also hold more than just one game at a time.
	</p>
	
	<h2>The Client</h2>
	<p>
		We will be using NODE.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for both client and server side programming, possibly more. The client will render the images for the board and the cards, but will not have any information about the other player. 
		The client will also gather player input and pass it along to the server. The client will also have a list of all the cards so that it can display the cards description and other 
		text on in the description box.
	</p>
	
	<h2>The Server</h2>
	<p>
		The server will hold the entire game state, this includes the current board, each players' hands and decks, and it will do any of the game logic that needs to be done. It will also 
		have a timer for turn times. The server will only pass on public knowledge to each player, the server will pass the info for the board and for the players hand whose hand it is. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Mockups</h2>

	<h2>Inspiration</h2>
	<p>
		Our gameplay takes inspiration from 
		<a href = "http://www.plaidhatgames.com/games/summoner-wars">Summoner Wars,</a>
		<a href = "http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/">Hearthstone,</a>
		<a href = "https://duelyst.com/">Duelyst,</a>
		and many other card games.
	</p>
	<p>
		Currently, our game draws from a handful of mythological sources for the lore. This includes 
		Arthurian legends such as
		<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excalibur">Excalibur</a>
		and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon">Avalon,</a>
		English folklore such as
		<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood">Robin Hood,</a>
		references to the Ulster Cycle of Irish Mythology in the form of 
		<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A1e_Bulg">GÃ¡e Bulg</a>
		and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnoc_Meadha">Knockma,</a>
		and finally old legendary Norse Viking <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar_Lodbrok">Ragnar Lodbrok</a>		
	</p>
	
	<h2>Libraries</h2>
	<p>
		Currently we're not sure of all the libraries we'll be using, but we will be using NODE.js as a framework
	</p>
	<h2>Data Storage</h2>
	<p>
		We won't be storing any data about a user's card collection because there is none, there are 6 prebuilt decks in the analog version and a smaller amount in this version. We're going to begin with a prototype deck for debugging reasons, then recreate decks from the analog game.
	</p>
	<p>
		The cards of the game will be handled by ...
	</p>
	
	<h2>Gameplay</h2>
	<p>
		At the beginning of the game, each player places their leader in the backmost row of the battlefield and draws a hand of cards. If they wish, they can take a "mulligan", which in our game is taking any number of cards in hand and putting them back into the deck, shuffling, and drawing that many cards. This can only be done once.
	</p>
	<p>
		Normal units have an attack value and a health value. Units can move 2 spaces (not diagonally) and attack units in the 8 spaces surrounding them. Units die if they take more damage than they have health, and you win when you destroy your opponent's leader.
	</p>
	<p>
		The analog game has 3 kinds of leaders with different rules, and 6 factions. We plan to begin with only 2 factions with the same leader type to simplify the digital game, which is meant only to be a demo for the analog game.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Controls</h2>
	<p>
		The game will mostly be mouse controlled with the mouse clicking on different cards and buttons to advance the game.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Story</h2>
	<p>
		This game takes place in old age mythological England with King Arthur, Faeries, and Druids. Players are sorcerers that are trying to gain control of the local mana springs so that 
		they can gain more power.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Assets</h2>
	<p>
		We are currently talking to some artists to get assets for the cards and game board. We plan to use the same assets for the digital cards, and very similar assets for the board. Peter can do some minor visual work if anything else isn't present in the assets for the analog game.
